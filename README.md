# JavaCodeBox

**JavaCodeBox** is my personal workshop for Java testing, code snippets, and early-stage projects. It contains code I created while learning, and it will keep evolving as I experiment, refine, and explore new ideas.

## What's Inside?

- Basic console projects
- Practice algorithms
- Class, method, and structure testing
- Utilities and Java pattern examples

## Project Status

**In development** â€” I'm actively updating this repository as I continue learning and cleaning up previous code. Think of it as a sandbox to sharpen my Java skills.
Some parts of the documentation were written when I was just starting to learn English - and I'm still learning!
So I'll be polishing things little by little as i get better with the time! :D

## Purpose

To consolidate my Java knowledge, store reusable code, and have a flexible space to test ideas modularly.

Also, if you'd like to collaborate, feel free to do so!  
Any feedback is truly appreciated.
